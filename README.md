# GatorMarket

GatorMarket is a **prediction market platform** designed specifically for University of Florida (UF) students. It allows users to bet on whether the average score of a course exam this semester will be higher or lower than the previous semester, inspired by platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket.

## How It Works

1. Each exam has a market created for predicting the average.  
2. Users buy shares for "Yes" (average will be higher) or "No" (average will be lower).  
3. The market uses a **Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR)** to dynamically adjust prices.  
4. Once the exam average is released, the market settles and winnings are distributed.
